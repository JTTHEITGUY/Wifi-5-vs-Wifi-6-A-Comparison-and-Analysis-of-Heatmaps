<h2>Technologies and Devices Used</h2>

- NetSpot (Wi-Fi Analyzer)
- NETGEAR ax1800 (Rax10) Dual-Band Wi-Fi 6 Router
- Linksys ac1200 (E5400) Dual-Band Wi-Fi 5 Router 
- MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- macOS Sonoma </b> 


<h2>Testing Methodolgy</h2>

For the Wi-Fi 5 (ac) and Wi-Fi 6 (ax) comparison, I used my MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021), which supports 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 wireless networking. Like all Wi-Fi 6 (ax) devices, it is backward compatible with previous Wi-Fi standards 802.11a/b/g/n/ac. Additionally, I employed a program called NetSpot Wi-Fi Analyzer, which is used for Wi-Fi network planning, wireless site surveys, analysis, and troubleshooting. This software identifies areas of channel interference and dead zones, providing various Wi-Fi metrics such as signal level, download and upload speeds, signal-to-noise ratio, and frequency band coverage. It also aids in troubleshooting by revealing specific issues like low signal levels, overlapping channels, high noise levels, and more. To use the program for Wi-Fi heatmapping, a floor plan of the residence or facility is required so that the heatmap can be superimposed over the existing floor plan. The specific residence used is approximately 2,088 square feet in size for reference.

The two routers used in this comparison are the Linksys ac1200 (E5400) Dual-Band Wi-Fi 5 Router and NETGEAR ax1800 (Rax10) Dual-Band Wi-Fi 6 Router. The Linksys ac1200 (E5400) operates on Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac), suitable for standard internet activities on dual-band frequencies, ideal for users with moderate connectivity needs. In contrast, the NETGEAR ax1800 (Rax10) utilizes Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), providing enhanced speeds, greater efficiency, and increased device capacity, catering to environments with higher demands and more connected devices. Wi-Fi 6 not only improves battery life in mobile devices and offers better network management in crowded areas compared to Wi-Fi 5, but it also introduces enhanced security features including WPA3 support, which provides more robust data protection and strengthens user privacy in open networks. This advanced security protocol, exclusive to Wi-Fi 6 devices, ensures a more secure and private browsing experience, making the NETGEAR ax1800 a superior choice for those requiring both high performance and enhanced security in their network environment.
